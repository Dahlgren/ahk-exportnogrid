# Arma 3 ExportNoGrid using AutoHotKey

Utilizes [EXPORTNOGRID](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/ArmA:_Cheats#EXPORTNOGRID) inside Arma to export the typography.

Compile to binary using AHK.

The script must be invoked as admin to function correctly.

Make sure Arma 3 is running inside a mission with a unit that has a map before invoking.

It will trigger the cheat code and open the map afterwards to trigger the export of the typography.

## TODO

Add x86 support as well.
